Define local history table, local predictor table, path history, global predictor table, choice predictor table

Initialize them with 0's


Local-history table indexed by the program counter 
Local prediction table indexed by localhistopry[index]
Global prediction table indexed by path history
Choice prediction table indexed by path history



PC based on the op-code we will check whether it is branch instruction or not if it is branch prediction is done on it.

Trace file will have PC values

then given to Local history table where we initialize it as all zeros
then it gies to local prediction table same scenario if it comes more and more we are going to train it

History length. Long history lengths can yield more accurate predictions [7] but also reduce the number of table entries, thereby increasing aliasing. In our experiments, the best
history lengths ranged from 12 to 62, depending on the hardware budget.

the best threshold  for a given history length h is
always exactly  = b1:93h + 14
Since the number of bits needed to represent a
perceptron weight is one (for the sign bit) plus blog2 
, the
number of bits per weight range from 7 (for a history length
of 12) to 9 (for a history length of 62).
