Define local history table, local predictor table, path history, global predictor table, choice predictor table

Initialize them with 0's


Local-history table indexed by the program counter 
Local prediction table indexed by localhistopry[index]
Global prediction table indexed by path history
Choice prediction table indexed by path history



PC based on the op-code we will check whether it is branch instruction or not if it is branch prediction is done on it.

Trace file will have PC values

then given to Local history table where we initialize it as all zeros
then it gies to local prediction table same scenario if it comes more and more we are going to train it
